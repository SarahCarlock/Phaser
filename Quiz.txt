QUIZ

Question 1
What command makes a new Phaser Game?
    new Phaser.Game()
    We call Phaser.Game() with new in order to create a new instance.

Question 2
What function do you call to create a circle GameObject?
    this.add.circle() creates a new GameObject that is a circle.

Question 3
What steps are required for rendering an image (like a background image) in Phaser?
    Load the image in preload() using this.load.image(). Create the GameObject in create() using this.add.image().
    preload() is for loading the asset, create() is for making the GameObject itself.

Question 4
Why do we maintain game state in a global variable?
    So we can refer to the same GameObjects across different Phaser Scene methods.
    We can use our gameâ€™s state to communicate between create() and update() methods, for instance.

Question 5
What code goes in the update() function for a Phaser scene?
    Code that runs  every frame the Phaser Game is in focus.
    This code might, for instance, detect keyboard interaction or just move a GameObject.
