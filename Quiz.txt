QUIZ

Question 1
What command makes a new Phaser Game?
    new Phaser.Game()
    We call Phaser.Game() with new in order to create a new instance.

Question 2
What function do you call to create a circle GameObject?
    this.add.circle() creates a new GameObject that is a circle.

Question 3
What steps are required for rendering an image (like a background image) in Phaser?
    Load the image in preload() using this.load.image(). Create the GameObject in create() using this.add.image().
    preload() is for loading the asset, create() is for making the GameObject itself.

Question 4
Why do we maintain game state in a global variable?
    So we can refer to the same GameObjects across different Phaser Scene methods.
    We can use our game’s state to communicate between create() and update() methods, for instance.

Question 5
What code goes in the update() function for a Phaser scene?
    Code that runs  every frame the Phaser Game is in focus.
    This code might, for instance, detect keyboard interaction or just move a GameObject.

QUIZ

Question 1
Complete the code snippet to add an event that loops continuously and calls the function increaseScore every 300 milliseconds.

function create() {
  this.time.addEvent({
    delay: 

300,
    callback: 

increaseScore,
    callbackScope: this,
    

loop: 

true,
  });
}

Question 2
What is the difference of a sprite created with this.add.sprite() and one created using this.physics.add.sprite()?
    The one created using this.physics.add.sprite() is affected by the game's physics and the one created using this.add.sprite() is not.

Question 3
How would this.input.keyboard.createCursorKeys() be useful?
    It returns a Cursor object that can be used to detect certain keyboard input.
     It allows us to check if the arrow keys, spacebar, or the shift buttons are pressed.
    
Question 4
What is the purpose of a Collider object?
    A Collider object checks GameObjects come into contact with each other and determines their interact.
        Can be used with Group objects, single sprites, or arrays of sprites!
    
Question 5
Given the following config object, how would a sprite created by this.physics.add.sprite() behave in the game?

const config = {
  type: Phaser.AUTO,
  physics: {
    default: 'arcade',
    arcade: {
      gravity: { y: -500 },
      enableBody: true,
    }
  }
}
    By default, the sprite will go upwards.
    Since the gravity property has a value of {y: -500}, the create sprite goes towards the top of the screen.

Question 6
What does enemySprite.destroy() do?
    It removed enemySprite form the game.

Question 7
What is the purpose of a Group object?
    A Group object is used to create and maintain multiple sprites as a collection.

Question 8
What method can be called on a GameObject to keep it from going off-screen?
    .setCollideWorldBounds(true)
    will prevent a GameObject from leaving the screen. 

Question 9
Given the following code snippet, what happens if sprite1 and sprite2 collide?

this.physics.add.collider(sprite1, sprite2, (sprite1, sprite2) => {
  sprite1.setVelocityX(500);
  sprite2.setVelocityX(-500);
});
    sprite1 will go to the RIGHT and sprite2 will go to the LEFT.
    Calling sprite1.serVelocityX() with a positive argument causes sprite1 to go right. The opposite is true for sprite2.

Question 10
Complete the code snippet so that when:

    the up arrow key is pressed, heroSprite moves upward.
    the down arrow key is pressed, heroSprite moves downward.
    the spacebar key is pressed, the game restarts.

function update() {
  const cursors = this.input.

keyboard.createCursorKeys();
  
  if (cursors.up.isDown) {
    heroSprite.

setVelocityY(

-500);
  } else if (cursors.down.isDown) {
    heroSprite.

setVelocityY(

500);
  } else if (cursors.space.isDown){
    this.scene.

restart();
  }
}

QUIZ

Question 1
Given the following tween (and this referring to the Scene object), will codey return back to its original position?
Code

const codey = this.add.sprite(100, 100, 'codey')

this.tweens.add({
  targets: codey,
  x: 500,
  y: 1000,
  ease: 'Linear',
  duration: 3000,
  yoyo: true
});
  Yes, since yoyo is set to true.
  Since yoyo is set to true, after the tween finishes play, codey will return back to the coordinates (100, 100). 

Question 2
What is the importance of calling setting a sprite’s flipX property to true? 
  Assigning a sprite's flipX property to true will flip it horizontally which allows the sprite to trun and continue animating.
  This means we only need half a sprite sheet to animate a sprite moving left or right. 

Question 3
If we have a sprite sheet that is 600 pixels wide and 50 pixels tall and contains 6 frames, how do we load this sprite sheet into our game? 
  this.load.spritesheet('spriteKey', 'spriteSheet.png', {frameWidth: 100, frameHeight: 50});
  It should have a frameHeight of 50 pixels and setting a frameWidth of 100 pixels will produce the 6 frames of the sprite sheet.
  
Question 4
Fill in the code to create a tween that: goes to the x-coordinate of 500, goes to the y-coordinate of 120, plays continuously, and does NOT return to its original state.
Code

this.tweens.add({
  targets: gameState.spriteOrCola,
  x: 500,
  y: 120
  ease: 'Linear',
  duration: 3000,
  repeat: -1,
  yoyo: false
});

Question 5
What happens when exampleSprite.anims.pause() is called?
  Only exampleSprite's animation is paused.
  we're calling .pause on a single animation.

Question 6
Fill in the code to create a tween that logs 'Hi!' to the console every time the tween repeats.
Code

this.tweens.add({
  target: gameState.exampleSprite,
  x: 300,
  ease: 'Linear',
  duration: 3000,
  repeat: -1,
  yoyo: true,
  

onRepeat: function() {
    console.log('Hi!')
  }
});

Question 6
Fill in the code to create an animation that continously plays at 10 frames per second:
Code

gameState.heroSprite = this.physics.add.sprite(0, 500, 'hero');

this.anims.create({
  key: '

run',
  frames: this.anims.generateFrameNumbers('

hero', { start: 0, end: 5 }),
  frameRate: 

10,
  repeat: 

-1
});


Question 8
What is the correct sequence to animating a sprite?
  Load in the sprite sheet -> Create the sprite object -> Create the animation -> Play the animation

Question 9
How do we play the following animation?
Code

gameState.exampleSprite = this.add.sprite(500, 415, 'spriteKey')

this.anims.create({
  key: 'animKey',
  frames: this.anims.generateFrameNames('spriteKey', { start: 0 , end: 5}),
  delay: 0,
  frameRate: 25,
  repeat: -1
})
  gameState.exampleSprite.anims.play('animKey');
  To play the animation we need to call .anims.play() with the animation’s key. 

Question 10
What would be a reason for using a sprite sheet instead of a static image?
  A sprite sheet allows us to animate the sprite and show moevement.
