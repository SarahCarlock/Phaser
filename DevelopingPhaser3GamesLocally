Developing a Single Scene Game using Phaser:

    We recommend using Visual Studio Code (VSCode) in this tutorial. If you don’t have it and need help install VSCode, you can find a more in-depth tutorial in our article about installing VSCode.

    Open VSCode and install the “Live Server” plugin.

    Use VSCode to open your game files, in this case, we have a game.js and index.html. If you want the simple game used in the tutorial, here is the download link.

    Click the “Go Live” button at the bottom of VSCode to start a server on port 5500. This will also prompt your browser to open a new window/tab that loads your index.html file.

    Make changes to your game files and save the file to automatically refresh your HTML page and see the changes you’ve made.

    When you’re done with editing your game, click the button that contains the port number of your server (by default it’s 5500) that will shut down the server.

Use the knowledge you’ve accumulated here to level up your own game development skills!
